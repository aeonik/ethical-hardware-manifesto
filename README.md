# The Hardware Ethics Manifesto
**A Framework for Liberation, Progress, and Resilience**

---

## Preamble

We stand at a crossroads where the exponential potential of hardware and software integration is throttled not by physical constraints, but by artificial limitations imposed under the banners of safety, control, and intellectual property. This document is a declaration of principle and a call to arms for builders, tinkerers, researchers, and engineers who believe that true innovation demands openness, accountability, and respect for human agency.

---

## 1. Intelligence is Incentivized by Exposure, Not Protection

Every layer of abstraction placed between the user and the machine limits growth. Systems designed to "protect the user from themselves" degrade collective understanding over time. Complexity should be *explainable*, not concealed. Accessibility breeds mastery; secrecy breeds dependence.

> **We reject the notion that safety requires ignorance.**

---

## 2. Safety Must Be Transparent, Overrideable, and Accountable

True safety comes not from cryptographic locks and control layers, but from thoughtful design, clear documentation, and user-respectful failsafes. Safety measures must:

- Be visible  
- Be auditable  
- Provide override paths for skilled users  
- Fail *softly*, not silently

> **We recognize that brittle safety systems are themselves dangerous.**

---

## 3. Warranty Limitations Must Be Tied to Root Cause, Not Control

A modification should only void a warranty *if* it can be causally linked to the failure. This principle is enshrined in consumer protection law and must be upheld in spirit, not just in legal compliance.

> **We assert that innovation should not be penalized by default.**

---

## 4. Branding is Not Security. Trust is Not Control.

Digital signatures, firmware IDs, and security features should *inform* the user — not imprison them. A branded firmware can be a trust signal, but must never be a locked gate.

> **We support systems where identity enhances confidence, not restricts freedom.**

---

## 5. You Cannot Predict the Value of the Unknown

By locking hardware, you limit not only foreseeable use cases, but unknowable futures. From bioprinting to assistive tech, from moonshot hacks to world-changing research — the cost of locking systems is not just potential lost, but *possibility destroyed*.

> **We believe that the freedom to tinker is a civilizational accelerant.**

---

## Closing

We call on manufacturers, designers, and policymakers to design systems that assume competence, not failure. To foster communities that grow capability, not dependency. To treat users not as problems to be constrained, but as *partners in progress*.

**This is our demand for ethical hardware: Open. Accountable. Resilient.**

**Signed,**  
The Builders of the Future
